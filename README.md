# **Expenses Chart Component**

This project is a Frontend Mentor challange completed with React & Tailwind CSS frameworks. To use React on this project is considered a overkill but I use React purely for practice purpouses. I also imported Daisy UI for tooltip class. I've added prop types for type security and added some more data to the JSON "database" file to make bar component more interesting and dynamic.

## **Tech Stack**

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Daisy UI

## **Further Improvements**

This project's state will be refactored to Context API and later on I will remove all useState hooks and implement a reducer to handle global state, again, I know this is an overkill but it's great to put new skills to practice using Fronten Mentor challenges. I think I will even add a JSON Server and implement some kind of DB fetch call.

### **Do To**

- Refactor to Context API.
- Refactor useState to useReducer.
- Implement JSON Server.
